# Project Overview

## Background

Qward is a framework for analyzing and validating quantum code execution quality on quantum processing units (QPUs). As quantum computing continues to evolve, developers and researchers need tools to understand how their quantum algorithms perform on real hardware.

## Solution Explanation

Qward helps bridge the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and their practical implementation by providing:

- Execution tools for quantum circuits on QPUs
- Comprehensive metrics collection systems
- Analysis frameworks for circuit performance
- Validation tools for algorithm correctness
- Insights about QPU behavior and limitations
- Comparison capabilities across different backends

This framework enables researchers and developers to identify performance bottlenecks, understand error sources, and optimize their quantum algorithms for specific hardware implementations.

## Current Implementation Status

The project is under active development with the following status:

### Implemented Features
- Base validator system (extends Qiskit's QuantumCircuit)
- Algorithm validators (Teleportation, FlipCoin)
- Circuit execution on simulators and IBM Quantum hardware
- Basic analysis framework with success rate validator
- Circuit metrics collection (depth, width, size, etc.)
- Execution metrics (basic success rates)

### In Progress / Coming Soon
- Experiments framework
- Parameter correlation analysis
- Fixed parameter testing
- Dynamic parameter testing
- Depth analysis
- Target performance testing
- Advanced analysis capabilities
- Visualization tools
- Complete data management
- Integration with Qiskit ecosystem
